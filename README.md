# Test behavior of classes or modules with PHPUnit    
========================    

This is an example of test behavior created using the sample Petstore sample from [OPENAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml).
