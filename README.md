# Test behavior of classes or modules with PHPUnit    
========================    

This is an example of test behavior created using the sample Petstore sample from [OPENAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml).   

Please feel free to download this repository and give the unit tests a try.

I used these repo as part of a blog post:  
[Test behavior of classes or modules with PHPUnit](https://#).

#### Tests

To run the tests, use:

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

##### OpenApi README.md

- [OpenApi AutoGeneratedCode](gen/README.md)
